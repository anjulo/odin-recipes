            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Injera is a sour fermented pancake-like flatbread with a slightly spongy texture, traditionally made of teff flour. 
                </p>
                <p>In Ethiopia, Eritrea, and some parts of Sudan, injera is the staple. Injera is central to the dining process, 
                    like bread or rice elsewhere.
